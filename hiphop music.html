   Jarad Anthony Higgins (December 2, 1998 â€“ December 8, 2019), known professionally as Juice Wrld (pronounced "juice world"; stylized as Juice WRLD), was an American rapper and singer-songwriter. Throughout his career of four years, he was a leading figure in the emo rap and SoundCloud rap genres which garnered mainstream attention during the mid-to-late 2010s.[5][6] His stage name, which he stated represents "taking over the world", was derived from the crime thriller film Juice (1992).[7]

Higgins began his career as an independent artist in 2015 under the name JuicetheKidd and signed a recording contract with Grade A Productions and Interscope Records in 2017. He gained recognition with the diamond-certified single "Lucid Dreams", which peaked at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100. It was included on his triple platinum debut album Goodbye & Good Riddance (2018), alongside the singles "All Girls Are the Same", "Lean wit Me", "Wasted", and "Armed and Dangerous", all of which charted on the Hot 100. He then collaborated with Future on the mixtape Wrld on Drugs (2018), and released his second album, Death Race for Love, in 2019; it contained the hit single "Robbery" and became Higgins' first number one debut on the US Billboard 200.

Higgins died of a drug overdose on December 8, 2019. His first posthumous album, Legends Never Die (2020), matched chart records for most successful posthumous debut and for most U.S. top-ten entries from one album, while the single "Come & Go" (with Marshmello) became Higgins' second song to reach number two on the Hot 100. His second posthumous album, Fighting Demons, was released in 2021 alongside the documentary film Juice Wrld: Into the Abyss and contained the US top 20 single "Already Dead".

Early life
Jarad Anthony Higgins was born on December 2, 1998, in Chicago, Illinois.[8] He grew up in the South Suburbs spending his childhood in Calumet Park. He then later moved to Homewood,[9] where he attended Homewood-Flossmoor High School and graduated in 2017.[10] His parents divorced when he was three years old,[11] and his father left, leaving his mother to raise him and an older brother as a single parent.[12] Higgins' father died in June 2019.[13] Higgins' mother was very religious and conservative, and did not let him listen to hip hop. He was allowed to listen to rock and pop music and was introduced to artists including Billy Idol, Blink-182, Black Sabbath, Fall Out Boy, Megadeth and Panic! at the Disco through video games such as Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and Guitar Hero.[14][7]

Higgins was a heavy drug user during his childhood and teens. He began drinking lean in sixth grade and using Percocet and Xanax in 2013. Higgins additionally smoked cigarettes before quitting in his last year of high school because of health issues.[15]

He learned to play the piano at four years old, having been inspired by his mother, Carmella Wallace, who later began paying for lessons. He then took up the guitar and drums while also playing the trumpet for band class.[15] In his sophomore year of high school, he began posting songs to SoundCloud which he recorded on his smartphone.[16] Around this time, Higgins began to take rapping more seriously.[17][18]
